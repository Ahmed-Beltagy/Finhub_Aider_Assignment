# Project Milestones Report

This document outlines the milestones achieved during the development of the Stock Dashboard project, including challenges encountered, how AI tools were utilized, and lessons learned.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and Architecture Design

### Accomplishment
Successfully established the project foundation by setting up the Phoenix framework with Elixir, configuring the necessary dependencies, and designing a robust architecture. The architecture includes a supervision tree for fault tolerance, an ETS-based cache for stock data, and a WebSocket client for real-time data fetching. This milestone laid the groundwork for all subsequent development.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Challenge**: Determining the optimal architecture for real-time data handling.
  **Resolution**: After researching various approaches, I decided on a combination of GenServers, ETS cache, and Phoenix Channels to ensure efficient data flow and fault tolerance.

- **Challenge**: Setting up the proper supervision tree to handle process crashes.
  **Resolution**: Implemented a dedicated StockSupervisor that manages all stock-related processes with a one-for-one restart strategy.

### AI Tool Utilization
- Used Aider (powered by Claude Sonnet via opto-gpt) to generate the initial project structure and scaffold the supervision tree.
- Leveraged opto-gpt to research best practices for real-time data handling in Elixir applications.
- Used AI to generate the initial README with architecture documentation.

### Lessons Learned
- The importance of designing a robust supervision tree from the start to handle failures gracefully.
- ETS tables provide an excellent mechanism for fast, concurrent access to shared data.
- Planning the architecture thoroughly before implementation saves significant time and prevents major refactoring later.

## Milestone 2: Finnhub API Integration

### Accomplishment
Successfully integrated with the Finnhub API to fetch real-time stock data. Implemented a WebSocket client that connects to Finnhub's WebSocket API, subscribes to stock symbols, and processes incoming trade data. Added fallback mechanisms to handle API unavailability or rate limiting.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Challenge**: Managing WebSocket connection stability and handling reconnections.
  **Resolution**: Implemented automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff in the WebSocketClient module.

- **Challenge**: Handling API rate limits and potential service outages.
  **Resolution**: Created a fallback data system that provides static stock data when the API is unavailable.

### AI Tool Utilization
- Used Aider to generate the WebSocketClient module with proper error handling and reconnection logic.
- Leveraged opto-gpt to understand the Finnhub API documentation and generate the appropriate client code.
- Used AI to implement the fallback data mechanism for resilience.

### Lessons Learned
- External API dependencies require robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- WebSocket connections need careful management with automatic reconnection strategies.
- Providing fallback data ensures the application remains functional even when external services fail.

## Milestone 3: Stock Data Management

### Accomplishment
Implemented a comprehensive stock data management system using ETS cache for efficient storage and retrieval. Created the StockCache module to handle stock data operations and the StockManager to coordinate subscriptions and ensure data availability. This system efficiently processes and stores real-time stock updates while providing fast access to the latest data.

### Challenges Encountered

- **Challenge**: Determining when to use fallback data versus waiting for real-time updates.
  **Resolution**: Implemented a periodic cache check that detects missing or stale data and loads fallback data as needed.

### AI Tool Utilization
- Used Aider to generate the StockCache module with proper ETS table configuration.
- Used AI to implement the periodic cache check mechanism in the StockManager.

### Lessons Learned
- ETS tables provide excellent performance for this use case but require careful consideration of concurrency options.
- Periodic health checks are essential for maintaining data quality in real-time systems.
- Separating concerns between data storage (StockCache) and business logic (StockManager) improves maintainability.

## Milestone 4: Phoenix Channel Implementation

### Accomplishment
Successfully implemented Phoenix Channels to enable real-time communication between the server and client. Created the StocksChannel module to handle client connections, provide initial stock data, and respond to client requests. This channel serves as the bridge between the backend stock data system and the frontend UI.

### Challenges Encountered

- **Challenge**: Handling client reconnections and ensuring they receive the latest data.
  **Resolution**: Implemented an after_join handler that sends the current state of all stocks to newly connected clients.

### AI Tool Utilization
- Used Aider to generate the StocksChannel module with proper channel handlers.
- Used AI to implement efficient broadcasting mechanisms for stock updates.

### Lessons Learned
- Phoenix Channels provide an excellent abstraction for real-time communication.
- Handling client reconnections properly is crucial for maintaining a consistent user experience.
- Sending the full state on join ensures clients are immediately synchronized.

## Milestone 5: Frontend Development with Svelte

### Not Yet Implemented

## Overall Project Lessons

1. **Fault Tolerance**: Building systems that gracefully handle failures is essential for real-time applications.
2. **Layered Architecture**: Separating concerns between data fetching, processing, storage, and presentation improves maintainability.
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Always plan for external service failures by implementing fallback data sources.
4. **Real-time Considerations**: Real-time applications require special attention to connection management, data consistency, and UI updates.
5. **AI Tool Utilization**: Leveraging AI tools like Aider significantly accelerated development by providing code scaffolding, research assistance, and best practice recommendations. BUt of course to master that it takes a decent amount of time.
